#AO3 Reader


###Q: Why is this dead?
**A: TWo main reasons:**
 * I suck at Java (and Android) development and (currently) don't have time to learn it properly (and it's probably too complicated to be half-assed anyway)
 * AO3 (currently) doesn't have an API, so the app would need to scrape the HTML (which would be its own separate project)
 
###Q: Will it ever come back?
**A: Hopefuly! I will definitely reassess things once AO3 gets an API (which is promised for some time), and maybe earlier if I find time/reasons to invest the needed time to learn Android Java.**
